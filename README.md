# mythes-el

This is a version of the Greek thesaurus file for
[Hunspell](http://hunspell.github.io/), that was created about 10 years ago by
a project called `openthessaurus.gr`. It appears to be more up-to-date than the
[package with the same name](https://packages.fedoraproject.org/pkgs/mythes-el/)
provided by Fedora.

The project was abandoned at some time prior to 2017. This repository is an
archive of the last known version.
